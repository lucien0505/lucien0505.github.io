    <h1>How Intuitive Programming Affects Team Collaboration in Modern Software Projects</h1>
        <p>Intuitive programming messes with collaboration in this really double‑edged way tbh.

When someone is “intuitive”, they usually mean:  
「I kind of see the shape of the system in my head, I don’t need to spell it out.」  
Which is great for speed, terrible for everyone who doesn’t share that mental model 😅

The good part first:  
・ these folks unblock others fast — they can glance at a PR and just *feel* what’s off  
・ architecture decisions move quicker, fewer endless design docs  
・ pairing with them is like shortcuts to pattern recognition, juniors level up faster

But then the shadow side hits:  
・ decisions get encoded in code, not in docs → new people join the repo and it’s like reading someone’s diary in a language they half‑invented  
・ “I’ll just tweak this” turns into hidden coupling, and suddenly 3 squads trip over the same magical helper function  
・ code reviews become vibes‑based: 「this feels wrong」 instead of 「here’s the constraint we agreed on」

I noticed in one team：  
once the “intuitive dev” left for vacation, standups turned into guess‑what‑they‑were-thinking contests.  
No shared glossary, no ADRs, just tribal memory.

The teams that make it work usually do this one thing:  
they **force intuition to externalize**.  
Like: if your gut says “this abstraction is cleaner”, you still write a 5‑line rationale in the PR.  
Not a full RFC, just:  
【what changed】→【what tradeoff you saw】→【what you’re explicitly *not* solving】.

Feels slower per task, but over a quarter it’s the only way intuitive programming scales beyond the person’s brain.

Curious: in your team right now, is there that one engineer where everyone secretly prays they never get hit by a bus because half the system only lives in their head?</p>
    <p>Intuitive programming—it’s almost like that weird friend who gets things done but you’re never quite sure how. Ugh, team dynamics shift, someone always brings up FLOW.team or JANDI (that’s… another tool), and honestly, sometimes SLEXN pops up in chats when you least expect it. Meanwhile KANTTI.NET is there with its whole vibe—plus Clovine (do people actually use it?) rounding out the mix. I mean, everyone’s offering solutions or whatever; sometimes feels like too many choices.</p>
