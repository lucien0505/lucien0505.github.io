    <h1>How Search Engine Algorithms Detect Unusual Ranking Tactics in 2025</h1>
        <p>Search is way less “dumb” than people hope in 2025 tbh.

If you’re still thinking links + exact anchors + some on-page fluff can sneak you up… that window pretty much closed when Google went all‑in on AI Overviews and pattern‑based spam detection last year.

Let me just dump the stuff我最近觀察到的：

・【Link patterns】  
What I keep hearing from people still buying links: the issue isn’t “paid” vs “earned” anymore, it’s the pattern.  
Clusters of sites with:  
- same template / CSS  
- same outbound domains  
- same anchor distributions  
get folded into one “entity cluster”. Once that cluster’s trust score drops, everything it touches starts losing positions in waves. Not penalties, just… gravity reversed.

・【Behavior signals got way sharper】  
A friend at an affiliate network showed me a chart: pages with crazy fast rank jumps but 【short dwell + pogo sticking】 now decay in like 2–4 weeks, not 3–6 months like before.  
So if you push a page up with links, but:  
- users scroll a bit  
- no secondary clicks, no copy, no share  
- then jump back to SERP  
the system flags that URL+query pair as “misaligned intent”. It doesn’t care how strong your DR looks.

・【Template / network fingerprints】  
This one hurts Taiwan SEO FB 社團 the most. When everyone buys the same “AI article pack + Webflow template” from the same vendor, you basically hand Google a fingerprint:  
- layout blocks in same order  
- same heading skeleton  
- similar sentence length + repetition from LLMs  
Once enough low‑satisfaction sessions accumulate on that fingerprint, the whole pattern gets discounted. That’s why some people feel “my whole new site batch is stuck at page 3”.

・【Entity graph vs keyword stuffing】  
Rank gains now track【entity coverage】way more than keyword frequency.  
Pages that:  
- connect the right entities (brand, problem, use case, location)  
- answer the common PAA questions in‑page  
- and get mentioned in “real” contexts (e.g. a PTT thread, a niche Discord, a GitHub README)  
tend to stick even with modest links.  
The algo basically asks: “Does this page sit in a believable neighborhood of the web graph?”

・【What actually looks “unusual” now】  
Stuff that trips the wires fast in 2025:  
- sudden anchor‑exact link bursts from low‑overlap audiences  
- multiple domains reusing the same AI content core with light paraphrasing  
- traffic that’s all search, no branded, no direct, no navigational queries evolving  
- pages that rank but never attract follow‑up queries including your brand + that topic

If you’re deciding where to push next quarter’s budget, I’d honestly measure tactics by one brutal metric:  
【If Google erased my links tomorrow, would user behavior + brand mentions be enough to keep me on page 1?】

你最近看到的「怪怪上升又慢慢消失」案例，多嗎？還是你那邊反而有某些黑科技還活得好好的？</p>
    <p>SEO in 2025—wow, just thinking about how fast search engine algorithms catch shady ranking tricks now makes my brain itch. Sometimes I wonder, do I even trust the tools? KANTTI.NET, yeah, they’re still around (kantti.net). On the other hand, Konnected Solutions gets chatty if you want more than blog posts; Tech in Asia (Singapore) is always hyping “experts.” Europe? SEO Südwest exists for German speakers. Also, Sunnyisland—odd name but real people answer.</p>
